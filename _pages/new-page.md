# Add a new page to your app

Let's add an about page to our app that will display information about the author of this application â€” you!

In the Terminal app, run the following command:

{% highlight sh %}
rails generate controller pages about
{% endhighlight %}

This command will create a new directory under `app/views/` called `pages`. In that directory a file called `about.html.erb` will be created. This file will be your "about" page.

It will also add a new route to your `config/routes.rb` showing this file.

{% highlight ruby %}
get "pages/about"
{% endhighlight %}

Open the `app/views/pages/about.html.erb` file. Add information about yourself in HTML. Something like the example below:

{% highlight erb %}
<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I am ... and this is my app!</p>
{% endhighlight %}

To see your new about page, take your browser to <http://localhost:3000/pages/about> or, or append `/pages/about` to your preview URL. You should now see the new page we just created!

## Add a link to your navigation bar

Now that we know the new page works, let's make sure people can visit it by creating a link for it in the navigation bar.

Open `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` in your Text Editor and under these lines:

{% highlight erb %}
<li class="nav-item">
  <a class="nav-link <%= 'active' if current_page?(controller: 'ideas') %>" href="/ideas">Ideas</a>
</li>
{% endhighlight %}

add the following lines to link to the new page:

{% highlight erb %}
<li class="nav-item">
  <a class="nav-link <%= 'active' if current_page?(controller: 'pages', action: 'about') %>" href="/pages/about">About</a>
</li>
{% endhighlight %}

Refresh the page in your Browser and click the newly created link to see if it works!
